# Cover-Op-Painters
To create a community based application for cleaning up graffiti throughout the city of Vancouver. We, as an organization, provide the materials and equipment for volunteers' use. The application shows all the locations of known graffiti on a map api, a picture of the graffiti will be provided for. Volunteers have the option to create a personal account to signup / create a clean up event. The creator of the event will need to pick up the materials and equipment for the event. Upon reaching the event, volunteers are required to sign in via the application. Once clean up has finished, a picture proof of the work is done. Once the proof has been assessed and verified by a moderator, volunteers will be provided with a peer evaluation. The peer evaluation's purpose is to give credit for the volunteers who actually showed up to the event and dedicated their time and efforts to the clean up. The application would provide a proof of volunteering if required.
